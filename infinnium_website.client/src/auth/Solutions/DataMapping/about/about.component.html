            4iG data mapping module is a critical tool for any organization aiming to understand and manage their data
        landscape comprehensively. It involves the process of identifying, categorizing, and documenting data assets
        across various systems and sources within an organization.
        <br><br>
        This module enables businesses to create visual representations that illustrate how data flows through their
        systems, from collection to storage and usage. By mapping these data pathways, organizations gain insights into
        data dependencies, relationships, and potential vulnerabilities. This insight is critical for enhancing data
        governance, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements like GDPR, CCPA, VA CDPA, or HIPAA, and improving
        data quality and security measures.
        <br><br>
        4iG data mapping module facilitates effective decision-making by providing stakeholders with clear insights into
        where specific types of data reside and how they are utilized. It also supports initiatives such as data
        integration projects, data migration efforts, and strategic planning for data management and optimization.
